# WebAPITemplate
Just a template for .net webApi documentation
Created this template because I started using a Mac from a windows 
and was having a hard time trying to figure out how to 
get things up and running quickly when creating an Webapi and adding swagger. 

Maybe this might help someelse. 
add nuget package : Swashbuckle.AspNetCore -
Enabled middleware to serve generated swaggerui in the Startup.cs 
updated the launch settings
"launchUrl": "swagger",
I will probably update some other things. 

1. Clone - build project and run 
When you run the project it launches: http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html
